Student Satisfaction Survey Dataset

Number of Rows: 543
Number of Columns: 33

The dataset contains data about students satisfaction on different services provided by the university.
The columns A1-A12 contains categorical data, indicating students basic information.
The columns IA1-IA6 contains numerical values in the range from 1-5 (1 = completely dissatified and 5 = completely satisfied) representing students satisfaction on Institutional Aspects of the university.
The columns AA1-AA6 contains numerical values in the range from 1-5 (1 = completely dissatified and 5 = completely satisfied) representing students satisfaction on Academic Aspects of the university.
The columns TLA1-TLA7 contains numerical values in the range from 1-5 (1 = completely dissatified and 5 = completely satisfied) representing students satisfaction on Teaching-Learning Aspects of the university.
The column OR indicates the overall satisfaction rating (1 = minimum, 5 = maximum).
The column satisfied has yes/no values showing whether the student is satisfied or not.

Your job is listed below.

1. Build regression models to predict the overall rating (OR column).
	- You must build the models using the following approaches.
		i. statsmodel OLS method
		ii. linear regression using scikit-learn library (without any regularization)
		iii. polynomial regression using scikit-learn library 
		iv. lasso regression (L1 regularization)
		v. ridge regression (L2 regularization)
		vi. your own implementation using formula of linear algebra
	- In your report and presentation, you have to compare their performance. 
2. Build classification models to predict the class label (satisfied column)
	- You must build classification model using the following approaches.
		i. logistic regression using scikit-learn library
		ii. linear SVC using scikit-learn library
		iii. build another classification model using Backward Feature Elimination or Forward Feature Selection approach.
	- compare the performance of the classification models.

4. Show the ROC curve for the best performing classification model you have built.

5. Show the correlation of the columns A1-A12 with the satisfied column. Which column is the most correlated with satisfied column? 
	
6. How can the university increase satisfaction level. Your answer must be supported by your analysis.

Special Points:
1. You cannot delete any rows while building the model. If there is any missing value, you need to replace them using a suitable method.
2. Use appropriate encoding technique (LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder) if required.
